This function takes in an array of integers representing the units of fuel available in the plane at each airport. It starts by initializing the number of planes to 0 and fuel to the first element of the array. It then creates a while loop that continues iterating as long as the current index i is less than the length of the array.

At each iteration, it checks if the current fuel is enough to reach the current airport. If it is, it subtracts 1 unit of fuel to reach the next airport and adds the fuel at the current airport to the current fuel. If it isn't, it increments the number of planes by 1 and sets the current fuel to the fuel at the current airport and increments the index.

After the while loop, it checks if the last airport has been reached or not, if not, it returns -1, otherwise it returns the number of planes needed to reach the final airport.

This implementation also ensures that the planes will always have the minimum fuel required to reach the next airport.

Here are some test cases that I tested on the code that I written.

Test Case 1:
let arr = [2, 1, 2, 3, 1];

Output: 2

Test Case 2:
let arr = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1];
Output:-1


Test Case 3:
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
Output:0

Test Case 4:
let arr = [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5];
Output:8

Test Case 5:
let arr = [1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6];
Output:3
